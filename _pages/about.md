I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the <a href='https://www.psychology.msstate.edu/graduate-programs/cognitive-science-program'>Mississippi State University Psychology Department</a>, working with Prof. <a href='https://www.psychology.msstate.edu/directory/jmoss'>Jarrod Moss</a> at the <a href='https://www.psllab.org/'>Problem Solving and Learning Lab</a>. Before that, I graduated from the <a href='https://www.bjfu.edu.cn/'>Beijing Forestry University</a> with a B.S. in Psychology in 2020.

<!-- I was honored to be named a <a href='https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2024-north-america'>Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship (QIF)</a> Finalist in 2024. I was a research intern at <a href='https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/'>NVIDIA</a> in 2024, a research intern at <a href='https://www.bosch.com/research/'>Bosch Corporate Research</a> in 2020, and an undergraduate research intern at <a href='https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html'>Intel</a> in 2018. -->


<!-- I am interested in the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and deep learning, with a focus on multi-modal perception, state estimation and mapping for 3D scene understanding. I am also interested in the application of these technologies in autonomous driving and field robotics. -->

My research interests lie in the intersection of problem solving, strategy selection, and individual differences. In particular, my work investigates: 1. How task representation affects strategy selection in problem solving; 2. How strategy selection associates with individual differences.
