I am a third year PhD candidate at the <a href='https://robotics.umich.edu/'>University of Michigan Robotics Department</a>, working with Prof. <a href='https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/katherine-skinner/'>Katie Skinner</a> at the <a href='https://fieldrobotics.engin.umich.edu/home/'>Field Robotics Group</a> and the <a href='https://fcav.engin.umich.edu/'>Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicle</a>. Before that, I graduated from the <a href='https://www.umich.edu/'>University of Michigan</a> with an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2022, where I worked with Prof. <a href='https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/maani-ghaffari/'>Maani Ghaffari</a>. I obtained my B.E. in Electronics and Electrical Engineering jointly from the <a href='https://www.gla.uestc.edu.cn/english/Home.htm'>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</a> and the <a href='https://www.gla.ac.uk/'>University of Glasgow</a> in 2020.

I was honored to be named a <a href='https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2024-north-america'>Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship (QIF)</a> Finalist in 2024. I was a research intern at <a href='https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/'>NVIDIA</a> in 2024, a research intern at <a href='https://www.bosch.com/research/'>Bosch Corporate Research</a> in 2020, and an undergraduate research intern at <a href='https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html'>Intel</a> in 2018.


I am interested in the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and deep learning, with a focus on multi-modal perception, state estimation and mapping for 3D scene understanding. I am also interested in the application of these technologies in autonomous driving and field robotics.
